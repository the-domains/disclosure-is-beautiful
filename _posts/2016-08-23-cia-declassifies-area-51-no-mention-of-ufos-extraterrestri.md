  The US government has admitted to the existence of a top-secret site in the
  Nevada desert, but the declassification will probably do little to calm
  'conspiracy theories' over UFOs and other rumors involving the place. George
  Washington University's National Security Archive obtained a CIA history of
  the U-2 spy plane, a high-altitude surveillance aircraft, through a freedom of
  information request, and released it Thursday.
